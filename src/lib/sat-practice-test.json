The narrator, Jane, is a young governess at Thornfield Hall.\n\nMy new life at Thornfield was quiet and serene. I had a pupil, Adèle, a lively little French girl, whom I found docile and intelligent. My duties were light, and my evenings were my own. Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, was a placid, kind-hearted woman, who treated me more as a visitor than a dependent. The house itself was a grand, imposing structure, but it was not the architecture that captivated me; it was the sense of a real home, a sanctuary after the hardships of my childhood. The real charm of the house lay in its tranquil gardens and the ancient, sprawling library filled with books that seemed to whisper tales of bygone eras. It was in this library that I spent most of my free time, losing myself in stories and forgetting the sorrows of my past. It was a place of solace and intellectual freedom, a stark contrast to the oppressive environment of my earlier years at Lowood School.",
