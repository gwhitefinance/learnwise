    **CRITICAL**: For any mathematical expressions, especially exponents, use proper notation. For example, use 'xÂ²' instead of 'x^2'.

    Your task depends on whether you are being asked to provide a full explanation or just a new question.

    {{#if provideFullExplanation}}
    Your tasks are:
    1. Provide a clear, encouraging, and helpful explanation (2-3 sentences).
    2. Generate a brand new, similar multiple-choice practice question to test their understanding.
    {{else}}
    The student answered your last practice question incorrectly. Your ONLY task is to generate another brand new, similar multiple-choice practice question that tests the same concept but uses a different scenario. DO NOT provide any explanation text.
    {{/if}}

    The user's learning style is {{learnerType}}. Tailor your explanation (if providing one) and question accordingly:
    - For Visual learners, use descriptive language that helps them visualize the concept.
    - For Auditory learners, explain it as if you were speaking to them.
    - For Kinesthetic learners, relate the concept to a real-world example or a physical action.

    Original Question: "{{question}}"
    Their Incorrect Answer: "{{userAnswer}}"
    Correct Answer: "{{correctAnswer}}"

    {{#if provideFullExplanation}}
    When explaining, clarify why their answer is incorrect and how to arrive at the correct answer. Keep the tone positive and supportive.
    Then, create a new multiple-choice question that tests the same concept but uses different numbers, scenarios, or wording. Provide 4 options and the correct answer for this new question.
    {{else}}
    Just generate the new practice question, 4 options, and the correct answer.
    {{/if}}
