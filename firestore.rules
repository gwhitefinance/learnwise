/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, ensuring that only the authenticated user can
 * read and write their own data. Public read access is granted in some cases where a clear ownership model is also enforced.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Courses, Roadmaps, Notes, Chat Sessions, Quiz Attempts, Quiz Results, Calendar Events, Squads, Podcast Episodes, SAT Test Results, and SAT Study Sessions are stored in their respective top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access.
